Task

  Your task is to implement the method <<<search>>> in the class
  <<<BinaryGenericSearch>>> using generics.

Specification

  The method <<<search>>> searches over a given array and returns <<<true>>>, if
  the value to search for is found.

  Implement a binary search. If needed you can add further (private) methods to
  the class <<<BinarySearch>>>.

Support

  To support you with implementing the method there are unit tests in
  <<<BinaryGenericSearchTest>>>. The unit tests are disabled at the start. To
  use them you have to enable them.

Further Challenges

  If you solved this kata already and want a new challenge you can solve this
  kata with one of the following constraints:

  * If you implemented the binary search with a recursive algorithm then create
    an iterative implementation.

  * If you implemented the binary search with an iterative algorithm then create
    a recursive implementation.

  * Implement the method without using an additional method.

Development Requirements

  To perform this kata you need a JDK 8 and Maven 3.3.x.
